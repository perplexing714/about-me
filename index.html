    Video games are a form of online entertainment. They can range from classical games like Chess, but online, to adventure games like Minecraft (?). Video games can be played on pretty much any device, on your PC, on your phone, etc. They can be played for many different reasons, some to have fun, learn, make money (sometimes) and probably many more reasons for different individuals.
